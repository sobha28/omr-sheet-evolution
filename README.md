Our project is an OMR Evaluation System that automates exam sheet checking.

It is built using Python and Streamlit.

The app runs locally at http://localhost:8501/
.

Users can upload scanned OMR sheets through the browser.

The system automatically detects answers and compares them with the answer key.

Results are displayed instantly with scores and analysis.

A SQLite database stores results for reference.

The frontend (Streamlit) is simple and interactive.

This saves time, reduces errors, and improves accuracy in evaluation.

It can be scaled for schools, colleges, and competitive exams.
